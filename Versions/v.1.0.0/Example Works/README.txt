In this folder, there is a PDF file and a TXT file. Both the files are the result of using the JAVA classes included in this
package to simulate the cleavage of the DNA strand by the endonuclease HindIII. This is to illustrate the capability of what
this JAVA package can compute at this present moment. Both the files show the DNA sequence of Chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis spp. 
after being cleaved by endonuclease, HindIII.
